## Estimations

## aligning motivations

## getting a team to buy in to "why" something should be done

## giving direct feedback rather than anonymous feedback

## building on the spotify model

## Creating space vs explicitly positioning/managing people (giving team space to grow)

Interesting thing you said - at roam you don't set specific roles in favor of people growing into roles. which is all well and good. But for that to work you also need to provide the slack or time space for people to try new things. And its you the managers that need to do that.

Because I dedicate and focus myself to my role I do it ok. But that dedication and focus implicitly means that I can't expand my role.

## Transitioning from building for speed to building for quality

for decisions - you probably had very short time to make decisions so you had meetings. If you want quality you should make sure that the people are writing first. Make them think through things and submit their propositions in writing before any expensive meeting. This can be informal such as wikipages

## focus on priorities not tickets.

## Prioritising production support over feature development

## Meetings


Running good meetings
Send out an agenda. make sure there is a specific problem to be addressed. limit the scope of the meeting.
Limit mandatory invitations to the right people, optional for others
Actively facilitate - make sure no one is left out and that no one dominates. Ensure the agenda gets resolved. This is vital. Take notes.
Send out a summary - private if applicable otherwise share widely for feedback and communication. In our case this would be slack
