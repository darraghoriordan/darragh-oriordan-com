Even in a cross-functional tema it can often be difficult to maintain a perfectly balanced cadence between develelopment and QA. This can manifest itself in legacy systems where work items can vary extensively for development, but where there are no automated regression tests the QA memebers on the team have to perform enormous amounts of regression testing for ALL cases.

The squad or team is supposed to help each 'function' in the team maintain a steady velocity. e.g. developers should stop developing and help QA get their cases done. If this isn't happening as much as you would like you might need to semi-formalise the process. I called this "dev testing" for the last team I was working with.

## The general idea

How, Why, When, Where, Who

## Things to watch out for

Developers are not QA
They are not as likely to check alternate paths
happy path testing is not enough
devs and qa often have different risk assessments
testing is hard and requires special knowlesge and skills

All the team must agree on what is risky and what isnt
Devs need to actually see and learn testing as a skill
