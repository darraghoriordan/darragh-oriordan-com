Here is a quick one. One of my colleagues was trying to figure out how to get the stunning windows lock screen images. They are hidden away in a folder on windows but this script will get them, rename them to .jpg and place them in a folder on your desktop.

You have to run it each time you want to get your windows lock screen images.

So save the script below to your computer, to run it right click and “Run in powershell”
