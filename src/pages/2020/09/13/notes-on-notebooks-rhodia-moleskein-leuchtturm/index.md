I've always preferred using a real notebook for jotting stuff down while working at a computer. I started out using no-name notebooks but I've slowly moved to using better quality notebooks.

Here are my notes on some popular decent notebooks!

## About testing and comparing notebooks

I'm comparing a Rhodia webnotebook, a Leuchtturm 1917 soft cover, a moleskine classic hardcover and a cheap department store notebook.

I purchased all of these on Amazon myself for whatever the going price was.

There's no science to my liking one paper than another other than how it felt myself! ðŸ˜ƒ

## The cheap no name notebook

![Cheap front](./images/cheap-front.jpg 'Cheap front')

| Specifications  |                |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Paper weight    | 90gsm          |
| Price paid      | \$2            |
| Cover           | Hard Cardboard |
| Number of Pages | 160            |

I love these cheap notebooks from the local Kmart store. They have 80gsm paper and the paper is ruled.

They cost just \$2. They're perforated for easily passing notes around and sharing. I usually clear out the days scribbles and dump it. These are perfect my throw away notes, calculations and shopping lists.

Because of the ring binding these notebooks lay completely flat.

There are no added extras, there's no bookmark or pocket here but that's totally fine because of the price and intentional use for these notebooks.

I only wish they had these without the ruled pages because I prefer blank notebooks.

### Advantages

- Cracking value for money.
- Soooooo cheap!
- It's paper sheets with a good cover. Does the job nicely.

### Disadvantages

- No extras like a bookmark.
- Feels cheap to use. No joy at all. Reminds me of school.

## The Leuchtturm 1917 notebook

![Leuchtturm 1917 front](./images/leuchtturm1917-front.jpg 'Leuchtturm 1917 front')

| Specifications  |                    |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Paper weight    | 80gsm              |
| Price paid      | \$32               |
| Cover           | Soft thin pleather |
| Number of Pages | 123                |

I tested a soft cover Leuchtturm 1917. The paper quality felt just below the Rhodia. It's really nice and bright.

![Leuchtturm 1917 inks](./images/leuchtturm1917-inks.jpg 'Leuchtturm 1917 inks')

I really liked that you can curl this notebook up in in your hands. It's also the lightest notebook. However it also it felt a bit flimsy. I feel like I need to take more care with this notebook.

![Leuchtturm 1917 bleedthrough](./images/leuchtturm1917-bleedthrough.jpg 'Leuchtturm 1917 bleedthrough')

Leuchtturm do sell hardcover notebooks also though. So this isn't a criticism compared to the other notebooks here. Just a personal observation.

Their hardcover options are

Hardcover - $38.50 - 249 pages
Hardcover real leather notebook - $180.00 - 249 pages

The Leuchtturm 1917 had the most "extras" of any of the notebooks. There is a printed index to fill in and the pages are numbered for you. This is the notebook you might want for lab work journaling or bullet journaling.

![Leuchtturm 1917 index](./images/leuchtturm1917-index.jpg 'Leuchtturm 1917 index')

There are 2 bookmarks and the usual pocket. There are a few perforated pages for sharing. They have included some stickers inside for labelling when you're done. This is a well thought out notebook package. I'm going to grab one of their hardcover notebooks if they go on sale.

![Leuchtturm 1917 extras](./images/leuchtturm1917-extras.jpg 'Leuchtturm 1917 extras')

### Advantages

- The pre printed index and page numbers are handy if you need them
- The labels are a really nice addition

### Disadvantages

- I didn't like the soft cover (I need to try a hardcover one)
- paper feels good but not great

## The Rhodia Webnotebook ("Webbie")

![Rhodia Webnotebook front](./images/rhodia-front.jpg 'Rhodia Webnotebook front')

| Specifications  |                    |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Paper weight    | 90gsm              |
| Price paid      | \$22               |
| Cover           | Hard soft pleather |
| Number of Pages | 96                 |

The Rhodia is my favorite "luxury" notebook by far. The paper quality is incredible, I generally write with gel inks and the Rhodia allows me to write effortlessly. Out of all the notebooks it's the one that really feels different from cheaper paper.

![Rhodia Webnotebook inks](./images/rhodia-inks.jpg 'Rhodia Webnotebook inks')

There are very few extras with the notebook, there is no index or page numbering but I LIKE that. It's up to you what the notebook needs.

![Rhodia Webnotebook pocket](./images/rhodia-pocket.jpg 'Rhodia Webnotebook pocket')

And finally the cover - while it's beautifully soft and supple it's also genuinely solid! This notebook will survive getting knocked around in a bag and being used daily. When you're done it will stand up nicely on a shelf like a hardback book.

![Rhodia Webnotebook bleedthrough](./images/rhodia-bleedthrough.jpg 'Rhodia Webnotebook bleedthrough')

I can't express how nice this notebook feels in your hand. It's just lovely. I highly recommend trying one if you want to keep notes for a long time.

### Advantages

- Absolutely luxurious paper and cover
- Cheap - \$22 is a steal for this

### Disadvantages

- lower page count than any of the others
- heavy and bulky compared to the others

## The Moleskine classic

![Moleskine front](./images/moleskine-front.jpg 'Moleskine front')

| Specifications  |               |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Paper weight    | 70gsm         |
| Price paid      | \$35          |
| Cover           | Hard pleather |
| Number of Pages | 240           |

The Moleskine was my first "decent" notebook. It's miles better than than the cheap notebook. It feels like nice quality. However next to the Leuchtturm with all the extras or the Rhodia with it's luxury paper and beautiful cover; the Moleskine just feels average to me now.

![Moleskine inks](./images/moleskine-inks.jpg 'Moleskine inks')

The paper is 70gsm. I could really only tell next to the Rhodia's 90gsm. It was harder trying to tell the difference between 70 and 80gsm.

![Moleskine bleedthrough](./images/moleskine-bleedthrough.jpg 'Moleskine bleedthrough')

The thing is that the Moleskin isn't cheap for the quality of the paper included! It was the most expensive purchase for me. You do get way more pages of paper admittedly 240 vs the 120ish of the others.

![Moleskine extras](./images/moleskine-extras.jpg 'Moleskine extras')

Anyway. Everyone knows the Moleskine brand. You will have a working notebook and it looks great. But there is better quality and value out there in my opinion. Buy this if you can't find the others or you need more pages.

### Advantages

- Lots of pages

### Disadvantages

- Expensive. You're paying for top marketing and brand with a Moleskine

## Looking at the thickness of each

The Moleskine is slim when you consider the number of pages. The Leuchtturm is skinny but it has the skinny cover.

![Rhodia and Moleskine](./images/leuchtturm1917-moleskine-backtoback.jpg 'Rhodia and Moleskine')

The Rhodia is a chonky boy for 96 pages but it FEELS amazing. It's soft and supple and the paper is just incredible.

![Rhodia and Leuchtturm](./images/leuchtturm1917-rhodia-backtoback.jpg 'Rhodia and Leuchtturm')

## Conclusion

I will still use a cheap \$2 perforated notebook for throw away notetaking alongside a Rhodia for main notes and journaling.

All the notebooks have advantages and disadvantages and they all get the job done.

Get the Moleskine if you want to get lots of pages, get the Leuchtturm 1917 if you journal in a laboratory or bullet journal. Get the Rhodia if you want a really nice notebook for archiving.

Ultimately the cheap notebook does the same thing for just 7% the cost of the others. You could have 17 cheap notebooks for the same price as a Rhodia. I wouldn't want to use a Rhodia for throw away notes!
