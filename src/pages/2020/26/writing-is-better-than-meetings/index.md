There are some very common types of communications in orgs. I prefer written communications for all of them.

I use the following steps, systems and checklists to avoid meetings and write effectively .

<!-- end excerpt -->

Common communications in organisations:

- Status Updates
- Information Sharing
- Decision Making
- Problem Solving
- Innovation
- Team Building

The default mechanism for these communications is often meetings. This is an issue because there is a physical limit to meeting attendance and the invitations and attendance are often not optimal.

You improve productivity by writing instead of interrupting five colleagues to join your meeting.

- Writing encourages you to think through the problem before involving others.
- Reading a written communication is asynchronous, allowing your consumers time to digest your message and do any exploration and investigations themselves.
- Writing, sharing and asking for input as a response or comment can make costly meetings obsolete and opens the discussion up to a much wider audience. - Written communications provide a knowledge-base and record of decisions for the entire organisation.

You compliment writing with relevant meetings. They will re-enforce your message and discussions in person are better than over comment threads. But consider starting with a well researched and written document.

Note: Any time you need to give feedback, do this backwards. Give feedback in person first and maybe follow up with an email.

## Research

You need to start with writing down the specific outcome you want.

Write down who your audience is and target the contents to them by identifying how the change or information will benefit them.

What is the pain for the organisation that you're trying to relieve?

Remember this writing is not going to be about what you want, but instead how it will benefit your audience.

Think about what they are optimizing for and how you can help that.

You should try to target one audience at a time.

| Desired Outcome                                              | Audience           | Benefits to them                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| More peers using the written form instead of ad-hoc meetings | Leads of creatives | Less time in meetings, increased audience, better decisions |

If you're struggling to frame the content as benefits to the audience, you might be shouting something no one wants to hear. Reconsider sending the content.

Researching is very specific to your content but I personally use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for all my notes. I have heard amazing things about [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/).

## Writing

The writing is going to be very different for different organisations, communication types and topics so good luck.

I've taken some amazing lessons from the book [On Writing Well by William Zinsser](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548).

For technical writing you should try to start with a summary that is easy to digest.

After presenting the audience with one piece of new information think about what question that will have given them.

Answer that question in your following paragraph and provide another nugget. Repeat.

Here are some structures/systems for how to approach content.

### AIDA - Attention, interest, desire, action or agreement

Start by getting the readers attention. Then build their interest - what's in it for them if they continue to participate? Speak to their desires and finish by specifying the action they need to take next.

Try to elicit the audiences' emotions, but never be manipulative.

### Borden Approach

Your audience will go through states as they consume your content. When you start they wont care much about what you're saying. Again you need to catch their attention, fill in the details and finally specify the call to action.

Ho-hum: introduction, the audience is bored, get their attention
Why bring that up? - build a bridge to get the audience to understand why it relates directly to them
For instance: give the audience specific concrete facts and stories to get them thinking
So what?: The call to action. what do you want them to do?

### Past, present, future

There was a time when, but today things have changed, as we look into the future....

## Reviewing

Give your writing some time to settle. Do not write last minute.

- Do at least 2 passes to simplify the writing.
- Get a peer review.
- Review your publishing checklist
- Confirm this actually provides value and needs to be sent.
- Send ðŸš€

I use this checklist when reviewing my writing

- [ ] Content: Is there an obvious audience?
- [ ] Content: Does it focus on what the audience needs to hear?
- [ ] Content: Do you address all the points you wanted to?
- [ ] Content: Is it as short as possible?
- [ ] Content: Is it factually correct?
- [ ] Content: Are you engaging the readers emotions?
- [ ] Structure: No long paragraphs?
- [ ] Structure: Uses simple words?
- [ ] Structure: Uses precise verbs over adverbs?
- [ ] Structure: How does it read out lout?
- [ ] Outcome: Will the audience need any further support
- [ ] Outcome: Is it clear how and what the audience needs to do next?

## Conclusion

Writing more will reduce the number of meetings you have to facilitate and attend.

Writing is not better than meetings where collaboration is key. I love a good whiteboard session or project kick-off with all stakeholders in the same room!

But in general you should try to replace most meetings with written communication.
