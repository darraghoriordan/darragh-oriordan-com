Some useful bash commands I use over and over at the moment and don't want to forget.

<!-- end excerpt -->

## To create a lowercase guid on the command line

```
uuidgen | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"
```

## To zip and password protect a document on the command line

```
zip -er <zipname>.zip <file(s) to zip>.txt
```
